      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Wildlife monitoring is crucial for biodiversity conservation, but traditional methods 
        like manual surveys, collar-based tracking, and camera traps are inefficient and invasive.
      </p>
<p>
  Manual surveys are labor-intensive and often limited by human error, resulting in data 
  that may not accurately represent animal populations. Collar-based tracking can provide 
  precise data but is invasive, potentially harming the animals being studied.
</p>
<p>
  Camera traps can be effective, but they require extensive analysis of the captured data 
  and are limited in their coverage. As a result, many areas remain under-monitored, 
  leading to gaps in data that are essential for effective wildlife management and conservation.
</p>
<p>
  This highlights the urgent need for a non-invasive, scalable solution that can provide 
  timely and accurate information about wildlife populations across vast and diverse habitats.

      <p>
        These methods can disturb natural habitats and are often costly and inefficient,
        especially when scaling for larger areas or mobile species.
