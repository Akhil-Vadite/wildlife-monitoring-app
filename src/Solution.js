      <h2>Mobile-Based Computer Vision Solution</h2>
      <p>
  Our proposed mobile-based solution leverages cutting-edge computer vision techniques, 
  such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to 
  detect and count animals in real-time. This allows for immediate data collection and 
  analysis, which is essential for timely decision-making in wildlife conservation.
</p>
<p>
  Using mobile devices and drones, we can monitor large areas efficiently, capturing 
  images and videos that are then analyzed on the spot. This significantly reduces the 
  time and resources required compared to traditional methods.
</p>
<p>
  The app provides features like automatic species recognition, behavior tracking, 
  and movement patterns, allowing conservationists to focus their efforts on areas that 
  need immediate attention. By employing machine learning algorithms, the solution 
  continuously improves its accuracy over time as it processes more data.

      <p>
        This solution provides instant data on animal populations, eliminates the long delays
        of manual data processing, and is non-invasive, preserving the natural behavior of the wildlife.
